# MATH 307 Applied Linear Algebra

## Python 

We will use [Python](https://www.python.org), deployed in Jupyter notebooks, to do computations. 

* No prior knowledge of Python is assumed. Detailed information on Python can be found at [Mathematical Python](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~pwalls/math-python/). 
* The UBC Jupyter hub [UBC syzygy](https://ubc.syzygy.ca) can be used to perform all computations required for the course. All students can sign in to UBC syzygy using their CWL. Once there, you can do computations with Python on your browser, without the need to install additional software.
* In the notebooks linked on this page, clicking on the "rocket" on the upper right side of the page will take you to UBC szgygy. **Note that the instructors do not have access to your UC szgygy account, so for assignments, you still need to upload your file to Canvas once you are done.** 
* The notebooks that you need will posted on this page, which will be updated throughout the term -- check the TAB on the right side of the page. 

Before the first assignment, please familiarize yourself with Python using the following two notebooks.
