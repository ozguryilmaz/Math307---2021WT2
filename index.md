# MATH 307 Applied Linear Algebra

## Python 

We will use Python, deployed in Jupyter notebooks, to do computations. No prior knowledge of Python is assumed. Detailed information on Python can be found at [Mathematical Python](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~pwalls/math-python/)

## Learning Goals

* Summarize properties and constructions of matrix decompositions LU, QR and SVD
* Perform matrix computations using mathematical software Python, SciPy and Jupyter
* Compute solutions of large systems of linear equations using matrix decompositions
* Compute least squares approximations of large linear systems using matrix decompositions
* Compute eigenvalues of large matrices using iterative methods
* Analyze digital signals using the discrete Fourier transform
* Create mathematical models of real-world phenomenon such as computed tomography and digital signal processing
